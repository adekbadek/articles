As a bit of a personal note, being able to upload this transcript feels kind of amazing. You often spend over a month preparing for a new conference talk, and then only a handful of people who were present that day get to listen to it. A few other people look at the slides online, without being able to infer a lot of context. Some people may watch it online a few months down the line, but this is JavaScript, and by then your conference talk is probably super outdated. I think that being able to upload talks in their entirety in text format adds a ton of value, especially if you can do it with a script that automates the bulk of that work. Basically all the script does is pull down your Presenter Notes from Keynote, and the images for each slide. Then it uploads the images and makes some decent Markdown out of that, which I can just paste into Pony Foo, as I've done below.

Without further ado, I hope you enjoy the format. If so, I'll keep posting these transcripts whenever I give new presentations! ðŸ˜…

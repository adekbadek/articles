Last December I gave a presentation in Krakow about Modular Design --- at Code Europe. I've also been fiddling with AppleScript a bit, and it turns out that extracting data from Keynote presentations and into JSON [isn't all that hard][script]. I've also put together a quick script to upload the slide images to S3, and after a bit of tinkering I managed to scrap together this blog post containing a transcript of the presentation.

Being far from a security expert, and having implemented a few different auth systems in my time, I can relate to the challenge of figuring out how to do this on your own. Luckily, there are many SaaS platforms that focus on identity management and authentication, sometimes referred to as IDaaS providers. I recommend using one of these platforms rather than trying to build authentication solutions themselves.

Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity by logging in with a username, password,and so on. Authorization is the process of verifying that a user has accessto a resource through the use of groups, roles, permissions, and so on. These features, and more, are also offered by these cloud-based IDaaS providers.

There are quite a few providers to choose from, but for this article, I'll focus on two that I'm personally familiar with. The first IDaaS solution we will explore is [Okta][okta], which historically focused on SSO (Single Sign-On) for employees, but have recently created a more developer-focused offering. The second we're going to review is [Auth0][auth0], which seems to have always focused on a developer-oriented solution.

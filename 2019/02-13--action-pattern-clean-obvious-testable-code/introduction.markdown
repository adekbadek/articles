When I first started writing software on the web, my code was a mishmash. Every project was loaded with unnecessarily long files and code left commented, thrown to the side of the road like an abandoned vehicle. The theme of the day was: unpredictability.

Under ideal conditions—the happy path—I was able to make my code work. But what I couldn't do was make my code work _consistently_. One time through my code would work, then the next an anonymous `500 Internal Server Error` would send me spiraling for days.

I was able to squeak by, but the thought of having to continue answering emails from clients that read "this isn't working..." was a life I didn't want to lead.

Taking off my beginner's hat, I started to see what other, more experienced programmers were up to. I'd heard about Bob "Uncle Bob" Martin in passing, eventually discovering [his Clean Coders series](https://cleancoders.com/videos/clean-code/fundamentals). I was hooked. For the first time, he was answering questions others on my path hadn't.
